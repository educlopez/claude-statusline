## [1.0.0] - 2026-03-04

### Added

- Real-time statusline for Claude Code with modular design
- **Directory module** — shows current working directory name
- **Model module** — displays active Claude model (e.g., Opus 4.6)
- **Context module** — visual progress bar of context window utilization
- **Usage module** — OAuth-based quota tracking with 5-hour and 7-day windows, color-coded usage bars, and reset timer
- **Git module** — branch name, changed file count, and line diff stats
- Interactive module selector during installation (toggle modules on/off)
- Non-interactive installation via `--force`, `--all`, and `--modules=` flags
- Background usage cache with configurable TTL to avoid blocking the statusline
- Uninstaller script to cleanly remove all statusline components

- Automatic `settings.json` configuration with backup on overwrite
- Per-user module configuration stored in `.statusline-config.json`
